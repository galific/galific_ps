You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOr you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.<br \/>\r\nPush the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWould you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?<br \/>\r\nThat is also possible!

Here again&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;has the solution to the problem.<br \/>\r\nWhen creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.<br \/>\r\nThere is also an integrated&nbsp;<strong>dynamic price simulator<\/strong>&nbsp;for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business transaction, without you harming your profit margin.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Remain the maestro of combinations<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don&#39;t want to offer them all in this set?<br \/>\r\n<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;will allow you to do this.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it&#39;s different to the one defined in your catalog.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour customers will then be able to&nbsp;<strong>personalise their selection<\/strong>&nbsp;amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Business Incentive<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIncentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and\/or&nbsp;<strong>spend more money per transaction<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\nPerhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?<br \/>\r\nAll of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!<br \/>\r\n<strong>Stop looking, you have already found the solution !<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo entice your customers,&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>3 possibilities are available:&nbsp;<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Offer a specific discount on&nbsp;<strong>each product<\/strong>&nbsp;in the pack<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Apply a general discount on&nbsp;<strong>the set of products<\/strong><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Apply a&nbsp;<strong>fixed price<\/strong>, such as a psychological price, for example<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.<br \/>\r\nThis decision will be made even easier thanks to our&nbsp;<strong>clear and clean-looking interface<\/strong>, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>You won&#39;t need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHave you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it&#39;s not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce again&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;has the solution.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.<br \/>\r\nShould you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack,&nbsp;<strong>the pack price will automatically be updated<\/strong>, and without you having to intervene.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the&nbsp;<strong>promotional implications<\/strong>, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIs one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute&nbsp;<strong>respect for the legislation<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be&nbsp;<strong>automatically deducted<\/strong>. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.<br \/>\r\nAlso, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will&nbsp;<strong>automatically be displayed as unavailable<\/strong>&nbsp;for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack.&nbsp;<strong>There&#39;s no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Highlight your packs and sell more<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice,&nbsp;<strong>optimizing your SEO<\/strong>, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing,&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack<\/strong>&nbsp;will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.<br \/>\r\nYour customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and&nbsp;<strong>able to finalise their purchase in one click<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd that&#39;s not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be&nbsp;<strong>highlighted on their data sheets<\/strong>&nbsp;for those being sold in lots<br \/>\r\nThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is&nbsp;<strong>cross-selling<\/strong>: an accessible method of&nbsp;<strong>increasing your average shopping cart<\/strong>&nbsp;!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>We don&#39;t forget designers<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer\/integrator.<br \/>\r\nThe module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module,&nbsp;<strong>to facilitate the integration process<\/strong>. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Pack 5<\/strong>&nbsp;engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.","tab":"merchandizing","version":"5.2.5","compatibility":{"from":"1.6.1.0","to":"1.7.5.1"},"nbRates":"163","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.0","price":{"EUR":249.99,"USD":289.99,"GBP":219.99},"badges":[{"label":"Modules Partner Creator","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/module-editor.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/616235-pprod\/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg","big":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/616235-pbig\/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg"}},{"id":"1048","name":"facebookpsshoptab","displayName":"Advanced Shop for Fan Page","categoryName":"Products on Facebook & Social Networks","categoryId":"459","categoryParentName":"Facebook & Social Networks","categoryParentId":"455","description":"Create a multilingual and completely customized Facebook shop","author":"Business Tech","url":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/en\/products-on-facebook-social-networks\/1048-advanced-shop-for-fan-page.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download","img":"https:\/\/medias1.prestastore.com\/img\/pico\/1048.jpg","fullDescription":"<div>Create a multilingual and completely customized Facebook shop<\/div>","additionalDescription":"<div><b>* * * WINNER OF THE 2011 PRESTASHOP AWARDS CEREMONY FOR THE BEST MODULE * * *<\/b><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Stand out from the competition and present your products on Facebook in a completely customized shop tab that will differ from the shop tab natively offered by Facebook and used by many merchants.(x)<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Effective way to increase your sales, the \"Facebook shop\" has become essential in the e-commerce area.

Known mainly in box form, it is reaching and increasing number of sectors: ready-to-wear clothes, cosmetics, food products...<\/div>","additionalDescription":"<div><strong>Are you ready for subscription-based e-commerce?<\/strong><\/div><div>This is a business model that combines e-commerce and subscription retail. So what is the concept really all about?<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Subscription-based e-commerce is an excellent way for brands and retailers to begin a process of getting to know their client\u00e8le and establish customer loyalty: <strong>the real strength of this economic system is simply its powerful ability to generate customer loyalty!<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Another advantage is that subscription-based e-commerce enables you to benefit from <strong>recurring monthly revenue without having to rely on the acquisition of new customers<\/strong>. What's more, subscription-based e-commerce encourages consumers to indulge and to re-purchase your products if they are impressed.<\/div><div>It stands to reason that there is no-one more loyal than a customer who pays a subscription, but be careful, there are a few down sides to the subscription nowadays: customers are developing an increasing dislike to being tied in. As a result you have to grant him a great deal of freedom; he must be able to cancel his subscription whenever he sees fit!\u00a0<\/div><div>If at the beginning of the month your customer no longer wishes to receive the product or products for which he has subscribed, it should not have to be delivered nor billed for. Nevertheless, the likelihood that the customer will continue to use the service is much more important than is the case with \"traditional\" e-commerce! It is the assurance of regular monthly turnover, alongside the ability to manage your stock levels.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Our Advanced Subscription module for PrestaShop takes into account all of these precepts and saves you the precious time that would be required to implement them manually.<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>The reason that the paid subscription model is developing so quickly within the area of e-commerce is that retail sites appear to find in it an effective solution by which to counteract one of the main issues that chips away at their profitability: delivery fees<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Amazon Premium, Fnac Express+, Cdiscount \u00e0 volont\u00e9... Many e-commerce retailers are now launching their own paid subscription services. In order to grasp the reason behind the phenomenon, one need only remember the fact that delivery fees remain the leading cause of abandoned shopping carts and that, on average, a subscribing customer is twice as lucrative as a non-subscribing customer.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>A few figures to quantify the impact of delivery on e-business:<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>87% of online shoppers systematically search for a means by which to avoid having to pay shipping fees (searching for a promotional code, addition of a product to the cart...).<\/div><div>44% abandon their purchases purely and simply on account of these fees<\/div><div>66% switch to a different retail site in search of delivery conditions that are acceptable to them.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Converting customers into subscribers enables online retailers to save time and money compared to traditional methods of recovering customers and generating customer loyalty, as it allows you automate part of the customer relationship. This saving can then be allocated to a free delivery service reserved solely for your subscribers, thus eliminating this purchasing deterrent and in turn achieving much greater conversion rates.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Objective: to generate long-term customer loyalty<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>In addition to the appeal of novelty, subscription-based e-commerce represents a formidable double-edged sword for brands that are reliant on distribution networks and that are targeting growth. In actual fact, first and foremost the subscription principle allows retailers to generate recurrent turnover and a stable operating account.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Thus, while subscription-based e-commerce may have cut its teeth with samples and travel-sized products, various other products now also appear to lend themselves to the model: in ready-to-wear clothing, cosmetics, culture and leisure, but also products intended for regular consumption such as mineral water or hygiene products (baby nappies for instance).<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Optimization of supply and of your logistics<\/strong><\/div><div>The subscription enables you to achieve an improved rate of re-purchase, thus allowing you to purchase from your suppliers more efficiently.
